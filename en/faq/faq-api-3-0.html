<h1 id="technique-questions--integration">Technique questions / Integration</h1>

<h2 id="11-how-does-the-cielo-e-commerce-api-solution-from-cielo-work">11. How does the Cielo e-Commerce API solution from Cielo work?</h2>

<p>The Cielo e-Commerce API solution of the Cielo e-Commerce platform was developed with REST technology, The used model is quite simple: There are two URLs (endpoint): one specific to the operations that cause side effects – such as authorization, capture and transactions cancelling, and the other URL specific for operations that do not cause side effects, such as transaction search.</p>

<h2 id="12-are-there-changes-from-the-credentials-15-to-the-cielo-e-commerce-api">12. Are there changes from the credentials 1.5 to the Cielo e-Commerce API?</h2>

<p>Yes, the credentials used in each platform are different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.5 - AFILIAÇÃO and CHAVE DE PRODUÇÃO are used. These credentials identify the store and destination account in which the amount of the transaction will be deposited according to the financial Cielo agenda. They must be send on the requisition body. Afiliação is the store’s register identification code on Cielo.</li>
  <li>New credentials are used: MerchantId and MerchantKey. These credentials are used to identify the store. In case they are not sent on the Header requisition, the transaction will be blocked by the API, returning “Error”. In an integration with the Cielo e-Commerce API, it is not possible to send 1.5 credentials. The API will deny requests.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<h4 id="15"><strong>1.5</strong></h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Afiliação</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1000000000</code></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="13-how-do-i-get-the-credentials-for-each-environment">13. How do I get the credentials for each environment?</h2>

<p>There are two environments on the Cielo e-Commerce API: Sandbox and Production.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sandbox</strong>: just access https://cadastrosandbox.cieloecommerce.cielo.com.br/ and register. Your credentials will be displayed after the registration.</li>
  <li><strong>Production</strong>: it is required to contact the Cielo accreditation central and request your credentials. They are sent via e-mail. About the accreditation central, access: https://developercielo.github.io/Guia-de-migracao-1.5x3.0/#suporte-cielo</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="14-is-it-required-any-proprietary-software-such-as-dlls-to-perform-the-integration">14. Is it required any proprietary software, such as DLLs, to perform the integration?</h2>

<p>No. The absence of proprietary applications is one of the solution’s characteristics: It is not required to install applications on the store’s environment under any circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="15-do-i-have-to-make-an-affiliation-before-testing-the-integration">15. Do I have to make an affiliation before testing the integration?</h2>

<p>It is not required an affiliation to use the Cielo Sandbox. Just access <a href="https://bit.ly/2cHdrzr">Sandbox registration</a> and create a test account. By the end of the registration, you will get a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MerchantId</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MerchantKey</code>, That will have to be used to authenticate all the requisitions made to the API endpoints.</p>

<h2 id="16-what-kind-of-content-is-sent-on-the-integration">16. What kind of content is sent on the integration?</h2>

<p>To simplify the Cielo e-Commerce API solution to the maximum, the integration is made through JSONs sending on a REST architecture. Each type of message must be sent to an identified feature through path and sent according the appropriate HTTP method:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>POST</strong> - The HTTP POST method is used on features creation or on sending of information that will be processed. For example, on the creation of a transaction.</li>
  <li><strong>PUT</strong> - The HTTP PUT method is used to update an already existing feature. For example, capture or cancelling of a previously authorized transaction.</li>
  <li><strong>GET</strong> - The HTTP GET method is used for querying already existing features. For example, transactions query.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="17-how-to-test-transactions-with-simulated-payment-methods">17. How to test transactions with simulated payment methods?</h2>

<p>To perform tests on the Cielo e-Commerce API, it is not required to use cards / real payment method.
Each payment method (Credit, Debit, boleto and online transfer) has a simulated counterpart.</p>

<ul>
  <li>C. Credit – Just use the Provider “Simulado” and send one of the cards included here: https://developercielo.github.io/Webservice-3.0/#sandbox</li>
  <li>Boleto - It will be generated an invalid boleto.</li>
  <li>C. Debit – You will be redirected to a screen where you’ll be able to select the operation result</li>
  <li>Online transfer – You will be redirected to a screen where you’ll be able to select the operation result</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="18-is-there-any-rule-for-card-reading">18. Is there any rule for card reading?</h2>

<p>The reading of card data on the environment itself is controlled by rules defined by the security program imposed by the card flags</p>

<ul>
  <li>For Visa, this program is known as AIS (Account Information Security) PCI. For more information, access: www.cielo.com.br &gt; Serviços &gt; Serviços de Segurança &gt; AIS - Programa de Segurança da Informação, or contact us.</li>
  <li>For MasterCard, the security program is SDP (Site Data Protection) PCI. For more information, access: http://www.mastercard.com/us/sdp/index.html, or contact us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, when meeting the requirements, while on the e-Commerce accreditation the choice by card reading on the store itself must be mentioned.</p>

<h2 id="19-is-it-required-to-use-any-certificate-to-perform-the-connection-to-the-cielo-e-commerce-api">19. Is it required to use any certificate to perform the connection to the Cielo e-Commerce API?</h2>

<h2 id="20-is-it-required-any-security-protocol-for-the-cielo-e-commerce-api-usage">20. Is it required any security protocol for the Cielo e-Commerce API usage?</h2>

<p><strong>It is mandatory the usage of TLS 1.2 on the communication with the API.</strong></p>

<p>SSL, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are not supported. Integrations using these protocols will not be able to perform transactions.</p>

<h2 id="21-is-there-any-ip-restriction-to-consume-the-api">21. Is there any IP restriction to consume the API?</h2>

<p>There are no IP restrictions or need of PROXY usage to integrate to the Cielo e-Commerce API.</p>

<h2 id="22-how-to-query-sandbox-transactions">22. How to query Sandbox transactions?</h2>

<p>The Sandbox environment does not have a report area, this being required a query via API to visualize transactions in this environment.
Check how to perform this query in our integration manual: https://developercielo.github.io/Webservice-3.0/#consultando-vendas</p>

<h2 id="23-the-cielo-e-commerce-api-has-sdks-for-what-languages">23. The Cielo e-Commerce API has SDKs for what languages?</h2>

<h2 id="25-will-i-be-able-to-consult-information-about-my-contract-along-with-cielo-tax-amount-deposit-deadline">25. Will I be able to consult information about my contract along with Cielo (Tax, amount deposit deadline)?</h2>

<p>No, data about taxes and charging amounts are not subject to consultation through Cielo e-Commerce API
These data will be available for consulting through the retailer area on Cielo website or via Cielo support.</p>

<h2 id="26-will-i-be-able-to-perform-advance-payments-through-cielo-e-commerce-api">26. Will I be able to perform advance payments through Cielo e-Commerce API?</h2>

<p>No, Cielo e-Commerce API is only intended to the transaction authorization process and updating online orders data.
Questions or issues regarding the financial agenda and receivables anticipation must be directed to Cielo support.</p>

<h2 id="27-how-will-my-integration-be-notified-regarding-the-status-changes">27. How will my integration be notified regarding the status changes?</h2>

<p>Status changes will be notified through a POST HTTP directed to the notification URL that must registered by Cielo support.</p>

<h2 id="28-how-can-i-query-data-regarding-my-sales">28. How can I query data regarding my sales?</h2>

<p>It will be possible to query through the API or via Cielo portal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API: Every transaction sent through POST generates an URL where it’s possible to perform a GET, where order data will be returned. More information at: https://developercielo.github.io/Webservice-3.0/#criando-uma-transação-simples</li>
  <li>Cielo Portal: It is possible to extract reports and search for orders from the Cielo website. More information at: www.cielo.com.br</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="29-what-is-a-transaction">29. What is a transaction?</h2>

<p>The central element of Cielo e-Commerce is the transaction, created from an HTTP requisition to the Cielo Webservice. The unique identification of a transaction on Cielo is made though the TID field, that is present on the authorization messages return. This field is essential to perform queries, captures and cancelling.</p>

<h2 id="30-what-is-the-deadline-for-an-authorization-to-expire">30. What is the deadline for an authorization to expire?</h2>

<p>The deadline for the capture of a transaction is defined in your Cielo register and depends on your company line of business.
In case a transaction is not captured within this limit, it ceases to be valid, not being able to captured anymore. The sale status will remain as authorized, but it won’t be subject to be changed.</p>

<h2 id="31-is-it-possible-to-perform-a-capture-in-a-moment-after-the-authorization">31. Is it possible to perform a capture in a moment after the authorization?</h2>

<p>An authorized transaction only generates the credit to the commercial establishment when captured. Therefore, every sale that the retailer wants to effect, It’ll be required for him to perform a transaction capture (or confirmation)</p>

<p>For Credit modality sales, this confirmation may occur in two moments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Immediately after the authorization (full capture) – it is not required to send a capture requisition, for it is made automatically by Cielo after the transaction authorization. Therefore, it is required to configure the transaction requisition defining the “true” amount to the TAG, as seen on the “Criando uma transação” section.</li>
  <li>Posteriorly to the authorization (total or partial capture) – As for the second situation, it is required to perform a “posterior capture”, trough a new requisition to the Cielo Webservice to confirm the transaction and receive the sale amount.</li>
</ol>

<aside class="warning">Attention!<br /><br />On the debit modality there’s no capture option. Every authorized debit transaction is captured automatically.</aside>

<h2 id="32-is-it-possible-to-cancel-a-transaction">32. Is it possible to cancel a transaction?</h2>

<p>The cancelling is used when the retailer decides not to effect the purchase order, being that for stock shortage, withdrawal of consumer purchase, or any other reason. Its use is mainly required if the the transaction is captured, for there will be debit on the holder invoice, in case it isn’t canceled.</p>

<p>If the transaction is only authorized and the store wants to cancel it, the cancelling request is not necessary, for after the capture deadline expires, the amount will not be charged of the buyer and the transaction will be invalidated.</p>

<h2 id="33-what-is-the-difference-between-the-notifications-for-each-payment-method">33. What is the difference between the notifications for each payment method?</h2>

<p>Every alteration on the order status will be notified via notification URL, that must be registered along with Cielo.
Each payment method has different a status and it may vary depending on the returned information.</p>

<p>Example: Boletos have no return for the payment confirmation. The payment method conciliation must be done by the retailer.</p>

<h1 id="questions-about-features">Questions about features</h1>

<h2 id="1-what-features-have-to-be-enabled-by-cielo-for-the-cielo-e-commerce-api-usage-in-production">1. What features have to be enabled by Cielo for the Cielo e-Commerce API usage in production?</h2>

<p>By default, each retailer using the Cielo e-Commerce API must request Cielo Support the enabling of the following functionalities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recurrence</li>
  <li>Anti fraud</li>
  <li>Zero Auth</li>
  <li>Bins Query</li>
  <li>Velocity</li>
  <li>Re attempt</li>

In this method, there will be made available different features to model the charge according to the business model adopted. Every parameterization is configurable , such as: periodicity, start and end date, attempts quantity and interval.</p>

<p>Own recurrence: In this method, the retailer will have to automatize the transactions sending according to his/her need.
