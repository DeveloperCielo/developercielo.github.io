<p><strong>What are transaction retries?</strong></p>

<p>When a shopper tries to make a card purchase at your business, a transaction can be declined due to a number of factors. The next attempts to complete the transaction using the same card is retrying.</p>

<p><strong>What has changed?</strong></p>

<p>Each card brand defines the amount that will be charged for retrying. The number of times a transaction will be retried also varies by brand.</p>

<p><strong>Are transaction retries allowed in e-commerce?</strong></p>

<p>Card brands define different rules for present and non-present card transactions, like in online sales.</p>

<p><strong>What is the impact for the merchant?</strong></p>

<p>Merchants who do not follow the rules will be penalized by charging fees for exceeded transactions, in accordance with each brand program.</p>

<p>Aiming to improve the shopping experience, the payment methods industry, together with ABECS, promoted the standardization of the response codes for rejected transactions made by card. Attempts are classified as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Irreversible: Never retry.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It means, for example, that the card was canceled for use, has been lost or stolen, there is confirmed fraud, the transaction is not allowed for that product, indicating that there are no circumstances in which the issuer would grant an approval. Any authorization attempt that has previously received an irreversible refusal without any changes in the message will not be successful.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reversible: Retry allowed.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It means that the issuer can approve, but cannot do so now, possibly due to a system issue (down) or lack of limit, suspected fraud or exceeded number of password attempts. These are temporary opt-out decisions made by the issuer that may change over time.</p>

<p>The Visa, Mastercard, Elo and Hipercard brands adjusted their rules to limit the number of authorization attempts for a denied transaction. These changes provide for the charging of fees for excessive attempts. Below are the rules for each brand.</p>

<h2 id="mastercard">Mastercard</h2>

<p>The Mastercard brand has the Transaction Processing Excellence (TPE) program, which includes two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Excessive Attempts</strong> – monitors the attempts of denied transactions, in card present and not present environments. Valid for both reversible and irreversible denial codes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Merchant Advice Code Transaction Excellence (MAC)</strong>– monitors transaction retries that are denied, in card-not-present environments that are irreversible. Billing only on (MAC) 03 and 21.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-excessive-attempts"><strong>1. Excessive Attempts</strong></h3>

<p>These are charges made when the merchant exceeds the rules for retrying transactions.</p>

<p>The brand also performs monitoring for any approved nominal value authorization, with subsequent reversal for transactions below 1 unit of whole currency or the equivalent of US$ 1.</p>

<p>Monitoring is applied to retry transactions for denied and approved purchases, carried out in a present and non-present card environment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All payment transactions using the same card and the same merchant number will be considered as retries;</li>
  <li>
    <p>Mastercard has extended the effective date to <strong>01/02/2023</strong> regarding the new program rules <strong>(Excessive Attempts)</strong> previously scheduled for the beginning of 01/11/2022. These are the changes:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The excess considered in the program will occur from the eighth attempt within the calculation month. The amount charged has changed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Mastercard is also introducing a limit of 35 failed attempts on the same card and merchant number per continuous 30-day period. Even if the shopper does not exceed the limit of 7 retries in a 24-hour period, but exceeds the monthly limit, the charge will be applied</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The current rule of the Excessive Attempts program is valid until 01/31/2023, where only 10 attempts to approve the same transaction are allowed (on the same card, and same merchant number), with retry allowed after 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="2-merchant-advice-code-transaction-excellence-mac">2. Merchant Advice Code Transaction Excellence (MAC)</h3>

<p>These are charges made when the establishment re-attempts to send authorization for irreversible response codes with the same valid card for a card not present.</p>

<p>Within this retry program, there are programs that are specifically designed for the <strong>“Do not try this transaction again”</strong> scenario. For these cases, Mastercard identifies transactions with the following values: MAC 03 and MAC 21, for example.</p>

<p>The MAC program accepts a few values, however <strong>only MACs 03 and 21 have a specific charge</strong>. The other MACs do not fall under this MAC 03/21 charge.</p>

<p>The other MAC codes: 01, 02, 04, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 aren’t included the MAC billing program but are included in the Excessive Attempts program billing if you exceed the limits.</p>

<p>Since <strong>10/14/2022</strong> Mastercard has introduced new MAC codes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30, when an issuer declines a transaction with the response code 51 (Insufficient Funds) followed by one of the MACs below, for the merchant to take the best action.</p>

  <li>63 (Security Breach)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Categorization of Mastercard returns</strong></p>

<p>Mastercard may consolidate some issuer response codes, which often may not indicate to the merchant whether or not to retry, into 3 codes for Mastercard exclusive use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>79</strong> (Life cycle)</li>
  <li><strong>82</strong> (Policy)</li>
  <li><strong>83</strong> (Fraud/Security)</li>
</ul>

<p>The original codes will be replaced by the Merchant Advice Code (MAC), which will accompany codes 79, 82 and 83 to determine whether or not the transaction can be re-attempted.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<h2 id="visa">Visa</h2>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>

<p>A program instituted by the Visa Brand that generates charges when the merchant exceeds the retry rules.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Valid for transactions with a present card and a non-present card;</li>
  <li><strong>Reversible codes:</strong> Allows up to 15 attempts to approve the same transaction (same card, same establishment and amount) within 30 days. After the initial 30 days (from the 1st attempt), any retry will be charged.</li>
  <li><strong>Irreversible codes:</strong> Only 01 attempt to approve the same transaction is allowed (same card, same establishment), the 2nd attempt will be charged.</li>
  <li>After an approved transaction, the counter is reset.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fees</strong>: When you exceed the attempt limits established by the brand, a fee will be charged for each transaction that exceeds it.<br />
<br /></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Domestic</strong>: USD 0.10 + 13.83% Tax</li>
    <li><strong>Foreign</strong>: USD 0.25 + 13.83% Tax</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Authorization rules already in force. Fee charges apply from April 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Visa has grouped return codes into 4 Categories.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Category 1 - Issuer will never approve.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For this category, it indicates that the card was canceled or never existed or that the non-approval is the result of a permanent restriction or error condition that will prevent future approval.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Category 2 - Issuer cannot approve at this time.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Indicates that the denial is the result of a temporary condition such as credit risk, issuer speed controls, or other card restrictions that may allow a retry transaction to be approved. In some cases, denial requires action by the shopper or issuer to remove the restriction before an approval can be obtained.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Category 3 - Data Quality/Review Data.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When a data error is identified by the issuer, this transaction is declined accordingly. Merchants must revalidate payment data before retrying. Merchants and Acquirers should monitor these negative codes due to potential exposure to fraud.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Attention</strong>: Category 3 has, in addition to the limits considered in category 2, a different limit, where it is cumulative. An establishment can carry out up to 10,000 transactions in a period of 30 days (in this case, considering only the establishment number and denial codes). If you exceed the limit, all category 3 declined transactions will be charged.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Category 4 - Generic Response Codes.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Category 4 includes all other decline response codes, many of which provide little or no value to Acquirers/Merchants as part of their retry strategy. Issuer usage should remain minimal.</p>

<p>Most non-approval conditions have descriptive response codes in Categories 1, 2, and 3 to indicate the reason for denying. However, there may be circumstances where there is no response code value for a specific denial condition. Issuers may use other response code values ​​defined in the VisaNet Technical Specifications; however, usage should remain minimal.</p>

<p>Issuers should use response codes that more accurately reflect the reason for denials. Categories 1 (issuer never approves), 2 (issuer cannot approve at this time), and 3 (Data Quality) should be used, and issuers should limit the use of Category 4 (Generic Response Code) to transactions where none another value applies. The Generic Response Code Fee is charged to ensure that no more than the regionally approved percentage of the issuer’s total denials are categorized as Category 4. Issuers exceeding the regionally defined threshold will receive the Generic Response Code Fee per base of transaction for each decline in excess of the defined limit.</p>

<p><strong>Table with rules and refusal codes.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://developercielo.github.io/en/images/apicieloecommerce/retentativa-visa-en.png" alt="Tabela Retentativa Visa" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Response code 14 appears in categories 1 and 3, but the accounting is as follows:</p>

<p>In category 1, EC is charged from the 2nd attempt to (same establishment and same card) <strong>retry not allowed.</strong></p>

<p>Category 3 comprises the group of codes for accounting for 10,001 transactions, after the EC reaches 10,000 retries with this group of codes, any transaction will be accounted for independently of the card.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> We had 10,000 transactions denied in a CE with category 3 codes, if transaction 10,001 is in code 14 or in any category 3 group code, it will be charged regardless of the card.</p>

<h2 id="elo">Elo</h2>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>

<p>This is a program instituted by ELO that generates charges when the merchant exceeds the rules for retrying transactions with the same card.</p>

<p><strong>Forms of Calculation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Retries</strong>: all payment transactions on the same card, validity, value, Merchant ID (MID) - within 30 days</li>
  <li><strong>Accounted codes</strong>: all negatives​</li>
  <li><strong>Excess</strong>: from the 16th retry in the month​*</li>
  <li><strong>Fee</strong>: BRL 0.80 (eighty cents) per retry, starting from the 16th</li>
  <li><strong>Billing</strong>: The billing will only be done in cases of recurrence, therefore, the establishment must be at least 2 consecutive months in the program.</li>
  <li><strong>Excess accounting</strong>: It is based on Elo’s internal controls. 1st to last calendar day of the month.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>ASI transactions</strong>: these are Account Status Inquiry transactions, that is, transactions carried out to query the status of a card (check that it is active). For this purpose, financial transactions should not be used, but specific transactions.​</li>
  <li><strong>Attempts per day (item 2)</strong>: consider for purposes of Hipercard’s Retry program from 00:00 to 23:59​</li>
  <li><strong>Reference month (item 3)</strong>: for purposes of the Hipercard Retry program, consider the 01st to the 30th or 31st of the month in which the transaction took place. The charge will be sent after the close of the subsequent month.​</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction codes</strong> considered <strong>irreversible by the issuer</strong> were categorized by the ABECS payments and self-regulation industry, through current Regulation 21. Return codes (ABECS)</li>
  <li><strong>Codes not mentioned in the ABECS manual are considered reversible.</strong></li>
</ol>
