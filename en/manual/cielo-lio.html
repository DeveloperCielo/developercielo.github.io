<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>With Cielo LIO it is possible that companies and partners have your application running on Cielo platform. These applications may or not be integrated to the payment, it all will depend on the company or partner purposes.</p>

<p>Below, you’ll find all necessary information to develop an application for Cielo LIO.</p>

<h2 id="development-environment">Development Environment</h2>

<p>It is required that you use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to develop your application. Cielo recommends that an IDE from Android Studio (version 2.2.2 or above) is used, seeking to assure the application operation on Cielo LIO platform.</p>

<p>For more details about the Android Studio instalation and configuration, <a href="https://developer.android.com/index.html">click here</a></p>

<p>For the creation of a new project on Android Studio, <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html">click here</a></p>

<h2 id="programming-language">Programming Language</h2>

<p>Cielo LIO accepts applications developed in Java or Kotlin..</p>

<p>We recommend that these languages are used to ensure that it works and to ensure the ease of integration with Cielo LIO.</p>

<h2 id="cielo-os">Cielo OS</h2>

<p>O sistema operacional da plataforma Cielo LIO foi personalizado e, com isso, surgiu o Cielo OS, que é baseado em Android.</p>

<h2 id="target-version-of-the-application">Target version of the application</h2>

<p>It is recommended that the developer uses Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop) as the application target version.
Thus, it is assured the working of the application on the LIO V1 hardware as well as on LIO V2 hardware.</p>

<h2 id="unavailable-features">Unavailable Features</h2>

<p>When customizing the Android of Cielo LIO, some features were removed to assure the peroformance and security of the platoform.</p>

<p>Below, the list of Cielo LIO removed features:</p>

<p><strong>Google Play Services</strong>: All services, APIs and apps from Google were removed from the operational system. Consequently, it won’t be possible to use the libraries that depend on these Google features.</p>

<p><strong>Componente Webview</strong>: This visual feature was removed with the purpose of ensuring the security on the platform and avoid that, from the installed applications on Cielo LIO, it is possible to access links and external contents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Attention</strong>: Cielo does not allow that the application from the client/partner be developed using the WebView feature. This visual feature makes the Cielo LIO platform vulnerable. In case the application is using WebView, it won’t attend the certification parameters and it won’t be made available on Cielo Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="development-frameworks">Development Frameworks</h2>

<p>Currently, Cielo LIO does not support applications developed in hybrid platforms, such as, Ionic, Titanium, Xamarin, CronApp and PhoneGap.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="dev-console">Dev Console</h1>

<h2 id="about-1">About</h2>

<p>Dev Console is an exclusive environment for the developer to perform the upload and the management of applications developed for Cielo LIO.</p>

<p>On the Dev Console, the developer is able to view all of his published apps, whether they are own apps or public apps.</p>

<p>Access now the Dev Console: https://www.cieloliostore.com.br</p>

<h2 id="lio-for-developers">LIO for Developers</h2>

<p>Developers who wish to get a Cielo LIO, can perform the accreditation on Cielo and request the equipment. The procedure can be performed via <a href="https://www.cielo.com.br/">Cielo website</a>.</p>

<p>After getting the Cielo LIO, the developer will have to contact via Developers Portal channel and request the enabling of your LIO to the Dev LIO, filling the required information.</p>

<p><em>An account on the Dev Console is required to perform this request</em>.</p>

<p>Our team will perform the required procedures and then, all applications published by the developer that are on Developed status will be able to be downloaded on your Cielo LIO of development.</p>

<p><a href="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/pt-br/content/suporte">Click here</a> to request the enabling of your LIO to the Dev LIO.</p>

<h2 id="public-store">Public Store</h2>

<p>The Public Apps are indicated to the developers and partners that wish to scale and make their apps available, to allow the download in all Cielo LIO equipments distributed on the commercial establishments (retailers) in Brazil via Cielo Store app.</p>

<p>To learn more about Cielo Store, <a href="https://developercielo.github.io/manual/cielo-lio#cielo-store">Click here</a></p>

<h3 id="upload-of-new-public-apps-and-new-versions">Upload of new Public Apps and new versions</h3>

<p>To perform the upload of new public apps, access the Dev Console and add a new app by selecting the public store option and after that, select the app file.</p>

<p>In case the developer is performing a change or update in a public app, the developer will have to perform the upload of a new app version. For that, click in Details of your app and start the procedure to add a new version.</p>

<p>To send a new app version, it is mandatory to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the most recent version has the same package name as the previous one;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the “version code” and the “version name” within the manifest file of the application.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="public-apps-on-cielo-store">Public Apps on Cielo Store</h3>

<p>As soon as the public app is certified, the developer will have to promote his app for production and from that moment, the app will be added to the Cielo Store showcase and will be available for download via Cielo LIO.</p>

<p>That is, commercial establishments (retailers) will be able to access Cielo Store via Cielo LIO, download your app and then start using.</p>

<h3 id="download-of-public-apps-on-cielo-lio">Download of Public Apps on Cielo LIO</h3>

<p>To perform the download of Public Apps on Cielo LIO, perform the following procedure:
Click on the Apps tab -&gt; Click on the Cielo Store app -&gt; Choose the app that you want to download</p>

<h2 id="private-store">Private Store</h2>

<p>The private store was a model created to allow the distribution of own applications developed by the partner. It is required to request the creation of the Private Store so that it is possible to upload an own app on the Dev Console.</p>

<p><a href="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/pt-br/content/suporte">Click here</a> to request the creation of the Private Store.</p>

<p>From the created Private Store, the developer will be able to publish his application on the Dev Console, selecting his private store.</p>

<p>The private store is essential for making the distribution of own apps to specific retailers.</p>

<h1 id="local-integration">Local Integration</h1>

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

<p>The purpose of the Local Integration from Cielo LIO is to allow that the developed application in Android is integrated to the orders and payment module from Cielo LIO through Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK.</p>

<p>In this integration model, all commercial establishment management and solution architecture are under the responsibility of the application that will use the SDK on the payment operation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The partner’s application running on Cielo sends information to Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK.</li>
  <li>Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK runs the fluxes to payment.</li>
  <li>The partner’s application gets notifications of the payment and continues its execution.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sections below have all the informations required to perform the integration in a fast and safe way.</p>

<h2 id="cielo-lio-order-manager-sdk">Cielo Lio Order Manager SDK</h2>

<h3 id="about-2">About</h3>

<p>Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK is an Android library developed based on Cielo LIO Order Manager API, encapsulating the REST communication complexity in an API thats is fluent and friendly to the developer and allowing a simple, fast and safe integration to the Cielo LIO platform.</p>

<p>The main purpose of Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK is to simplify the integration to the payments system and allow that the developer focus efforts on the development of his application’s characteristics.
Below, it is presented an exemple in high-level of the Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK utilization process by a partner application:</p>

<p><img src="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/sdk-order.jpg" alt="flux" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The partner application is responsible for managing all the order informations, and then, send them to Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK.</li>
  <li>Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK receives the informations and the payment flux for the costumer. In this flux, the costumer will select the payment method and enter the password on the Pinpad, having the possibility to send the payment voucher via e-mail.</li>
  <li>By the end of the payment flux, the partner application receives all information about the payment performed and goes back on running on the Cielo LIO screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more information and details about the development of an application for Cielo LIO, access the documentation Develop an App for LIO..</p>

<h3 id="sandbox-environment---emulator">Sandbox Environment - Emulator</h3>

<p>This application works like a proxy from all calls that the SDK would send LIO. It simply treats these calls and emulates the possible types of return to the costumer’s application, allowing that the developer performs the tests on the SDK methods and perform the debug of the application during the development and the integration to Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK, without the need of having a Cielo LIO hardware.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not even required to let this app opened. As soon as the customer application use an OrderManager function that would call LIO, the application gets in first plan for the selection of what must be returned (Success, Error or Cancellation)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Download the emulator .apk on the link below:</p>

<p><a href="https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/cielo-lio-emulator/latest-release/lio-emulator.apk">Emulator Download</a></p>

<p>To install the application, just follow the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access the configurations of your device and go to the “Security” menu;</li>
  <li>Locate the “Unknown Sources” item, on the “Device administration” section</li>
  <li>Touch the key on the side and confirm your choice to start allowing the installation of APK files downloaded by alternative sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="configure-modules-and-dependencies">Configure modules and dependencies</h3>

<p>After configuring a new project on Android Studio, it is required to include the dependency below on the project.</p>

<p>For release version, add the module from Cielo LIO Manager SDK on the Gradle dependencies:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>compile 'com.cielo.lio:order-manager:0.19.5'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>last version 0.19.4 - launched in 25/07/2018</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the version 1.17.7-beta of the SDK, it has become required the permission of INTERNET on the costumer application.
Add this permission to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code> of your application.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="credentials">Credentials</h3>

<p>To use Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK, it is required to insert the following credentials on the OrderManager initialization:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Credentials</span> <span class="n">credentials</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Credentials</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Your client id here"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"Your accessToken here"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Client-Id
Its generation occurs at the moment of the creation by the developer panel. Its value can be viewed on the Client ID column, within the menu ‘Developer’ -&gt; ‘Registered Client ID’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access-Token
Access-token identification, that stores the access rules allowed to the Client ID. Its generation occurs at the moment of the Client ID creation by the developer panel. Its value can be viewed by clicking in “details” on the ‘Access Tokens’ column, within the menu ‘Developer’ -&gt; ‘Registered Client ID’.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orders-creation-and-management">Orders Creation and Management</h2>

<p>The basic flux for the SDK utilization can be divided in 4 steps, as on the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/fluxogram-lio-sdk.png" alt="order manager sdk flux" /></p>

<p>Below, we’ll show how to perform each of these steps.</p>

<h3 id="create-ordermanager">Create OrderManager</h3>

<p>This method allows starting the OrderManager, that is responsible for the main Cielo LIO Order Manager SDK operations. The OrderManager represents the interface with the Order Manager REST API.</p>

<p>It all starts with the OrderManager creation!</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">OrderManager</span> <span class="n">orderManager</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">OrderManager</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">credentials</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The OrderManager constructor gets 2 parameters:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Domain</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>credentials</td>
      <td>Access credentials of the Partner/Developer. After registering on the Developers Portal and creating his app, the Partner/Developer gets the (Client-ID and Access-Token) credentials. They are for identifying him uniquely on LIO platform and to differentiate the orders of his application.</td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cielo.sdk.order.Credentials</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>context</td>
      <td>The application context.</td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">android.content.Context</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Attention:</strong> We recommend creating/initializing OrderManager on the partner’s application at the moment that you’ll use the functionalities, looking to optimize the application performance</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="link-the-application-context-to-the-sdk">Link the application context to the SDK</h3>

<p>With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bind()</code> method, it is possible to link the application context to the SDK. This service is responsible for managing the functions related to the orders from LIO.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">ServiceBindListener</span> <span class="n">serviceBindListener</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ServiceBindListener</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Attention:</strong> You have to ensure that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onServiceBound()</code> listener was called before using the OrderManager functions, otherwise an exception will be launched, causing a crash in your application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bind method gets two parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>context:</strong> object that will provide the context in which the service will be linked..</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>serviceBindListener:</strong> listener that notifies the connection state with the OrderManager service.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the OrderManager initialized and after the onServiceBound method execution, it becomes possible to go to the next step and create an order (Order class).</p>

<h3 id="create-an-order">Create an order</h3>

<p>Cielo LIO works with the Order (order) concept. It is required to have an order to, then, perform the payment(s).</p>

<p>This method allows creating an Order (Order class). To perform this creation, use the createDraftOrder method, that will make available an Order with DRAFT status:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Order</span> <span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">orderManager</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createDraftOrder</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"ORDER_REFERENCE"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="add-items-in-an-order">Add items in an order</h3>

<p>This method allows that items are added in an order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Attention:</strong> It is required to add at least an item to an order so that it is possible to continue with the payment.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Product identification (Stock Keeping Unit)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="release-order-to-payment">Release order to payment</h3>

<p>This method allows updating the status of an order and release it to payment. The purpose is to use this method after adding all items on the order.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">orderManager</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">placeOrder</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the execution of this method, the Order status will change from DRAFT to ENTERED, allowing that it gets paid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Attention:</strong> It is important to notice that, once an Order changes status to ENTERED, it will no longer be possible to include any items on it.
Start payment process</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This method allows starting the payment process on Cielo LIO.</p>

<p>Are available some ways to call the checkoutOrder method:</p>

<p><img src="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/checkoutOrder.jpg" alt="checkoutorder ways" /></p>

<p>Independently on the chosen way, you’ll have to use the following callback as parameter of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkoutOrder()</code> method to receive the states related to the payment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PaymentListener: A callback that informs about all actions taken during the payment process.
The following actions can be notified:<br />
• onStart - When a payment is started.
• onPayment - When a payment is performed. Notice that an order may be paid by more than one payment.
• onCancel - When the payment is canceled.
• onError - When there’s an error on the order payment.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onPayment()</code> method returns an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Order</code> object with a list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Payment</code> that has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PaymentFields</code> HashMap with most of the transaction data.

  <p><strong>Attention:</strong> On the version 0.19.0 of the SDK, there were introducted payment codes for the main operations provided on LIO, thus making the payment calls easier. It is important to emphasize that the payment ways are configured according to the commercial establishment, and not all will be available in all terminals. In case the selected payment method is not available on the LIO, there will be an excepetion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NoSuchElementException</code>type.</p>

<p><a href="https://developercielo.github.io/manual/cielo-lio#cancelar-parte-do-valor-de-um-pagamento">Cancel Part of the Payment Amount</a></p>

<p>Independently on the chosen way, you’ll have to use the following callback as parameter of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancelOrder()</code> method to receive the states related to the payment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CancellationListener: A callback that informs about all actions taken during the cancellation process.
The following actions can be notified:
• onSuccess - When a cancellation is successfully performed.
• onCancel - When the user cancels the operation.
• onError - When there’s an error on the order cancellation.</p>

<h2 id="presentation-1">Presentation</h2>

<p>The purpose of the Cielo LIO Remote Integration is to allow that the retailer continues on using his cashier front solution (Commercial Automation or PDV) and integrates it to the Cielo LIO payments and orders module through an API built on RESTful standard.</p>

<p>Thus, all commercial establishment management will be under the Commercial Automation responsibility and, at the moment of performing the payment, Cielo LIO is used.</p>

<p><img src="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/diagrama-overview.jpg" alt="remote integration" /></p>

<p>the Cielo LIO Order Manager API has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REST features, in a way that it is possible to access through the standard HTTP semantic.</li>
  <li>HTTP status codes to communicate the success/error on the calls.</li>
  <li>All requisitions and answers are in JSON format.</li>
  <li>The sections below have all information required to perform the integration in a fast and safe way.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="demo-video-1">Demo video</h2>

<h2 id="docs-api">Docs API</h2>

<p>In this documentation, the developer finds all information about Endpoints, Entities and Features available on the API.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to query all input data, acquisition examples and output data. As well as understand the basic usage flux of the Cielo Lio’s Order Manager API.</p>

<h3 id="endpoints">Endpoints</h3>

<p>All calls must be executed using the respective credentials from the Sanbox environment and production.</p>

<h4 id="sandbox">Sandbox</h4>

<p>Sandbox environment is destined to tests with Cielo partners. This environment uses integration simulators. Thus, the operations are not executed in productive environment.</p>

<p>To use the Sandbox environment, it is not required that you provide the establishment number. You will be able to start the tests without the need of having a Cielo LIO. To get the sandbox tokens, create an account on the portal and create the Client-Id.</p>

<p>Use the sandbox address below to perform the tests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>https://api.cielo.com.br/sandbox-lio/order-management/v1</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="production">Production</h4>

<p>The production environment is the transactional environment integrated to the Cielo environment. The operations performed in this environment cannot be undone.</p>

<p>To use the production environment, it is required that you contact through the form. Along with personal data, provide the establishment number. To use the production environment, it is required that you have a Cielo LIO.</p>

<p>Use the production address below to perform the requisitions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>https://api.cielo.com.br/order-management/v1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you already done the sandbox tests and wish to request the tokens?</p>

<p>Click on <a href="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/content/solicitar-tokens-para-producao">Request Tokens</a> or access the “Developer” menu on the Developers Portal and choose the option “Request tokens”.</p>

<p>You have to be logged in!</p>

<h3 id="http-headers-1">HTTP Headers</h3>

<p>All Remote Integration Cielo LIO Order Manager API calls require that the information below are present on the requisition Header:</p>

<p><strong>Client-Id</strong>: Access ID. Its generation occurs at the moment of the creation by the developer panel. Its value can be viewed on the “Client ID” column, within the menu “Developer” -&gt; “Registered Client ID”.</p>

<p><strong>Access-Token</strong>: Access token ID, that stores the access rules allowed to the Client ID. Its generation occurs at the moment of the Client ID generation by the developer panel. Its value can be viewd by clicking on “details” on the “Access Tokens” column, within the menu “Developer” -&gt; “Registered Client ID”.</p>

<p><strong>Merchant-Id</strong>: Token that identifies the commercial establishment inside the Order Manager server from Cielo LIO. Its generation occurs during the Client ID registering process. Its value can be viewd on the “Merchant ID” column, withing the menu “Developer” -&gt; “Registered Client ID”.</p>

<h3 id="basic-flux-usage-cielo-lio-order-manager-api">Basic Flux Usage Cielo LIO Order Manager API</h3>

<p>Below you can find a basic flux to send an order to Cielo LIO using the Remote Integration:</p>

<p><img src="https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/fluxogram-order-manager-slim.png" alt="basic_flux" /></p>

<h3 id="changes-notifications-on-the-order">Changes Notifications on the Order</h3>

<p>The biggest reason for the Order Manager’s RESTful API availability is to allow partner applications to integrate to Cielo’s cloud platform. However, once partner applications submit orders, they must be paid locally at Cielo LIO. Therefore, partner applications need a way to receive status changes notifications and from transactions performed in the Order.</p>

<p>For such, it is required that the partner makes available a RESTful Backend, that will get the notifications following the format below. Once the informations are received, the Backend has the liberty to be used on the most appropriate way to the business model.</p>

<h4 id="put---status-change-notification">PUT - Status Change Notification</h4>

<p>In each status notification in an order, the Order Manager server sends, via command, the informations to the partner’s Backend.</p>
