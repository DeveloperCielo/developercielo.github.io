# Introduction

The EDI - Eletronic Data Interchange is a channel of capture and processing of large transactions volume in lot, through changing the files between the client, the files transmission partner (VANs) and Cielo.

This channel is indicated for:

- Authorizing Credit and Installment transactions, mainly recurring transactions, ex.: Publishers, Insurers,Gyms, etc.
- Cancelling Credit, Installment and Debit transactions, independently on the authorization channel: Machine / TEF / E-Commerce / Mobile or EDI.
- Capture for the processing, in Base II, from the transactions of Airline companies, sent by IATA (International Air Transport Association).
- Transmission of the electronic statement (specific integration manual)

## Target Audience

There is no restriction on the use of this Channel. However, the client's business needs may or not make feasible the use of this capture channel.

As described above, some characteristics are required:

- Transactions authorization: indicated to clients with the need of authorizing large transactions volume, mainly recurring transactions (gyms, insurers, subscriptions, etc).
- Transactions cancellation: Indicated to clients with the need of cancelling large transactions volume, in an automatized way.
- IATA transactions: used by International airline companies that are part of the IATA and GDS system.
- Electronic statement: indicated to clients with large transactions volume, with the purpose of making the financial conciliation easier.

## EDI in 4 steps

To use the EDI capture channel, four steps are required:

1. Accreditation: the client has to be accredited to Cielo;
2. Integration: to perform the development according to the manual to integrate to the EDI. Note: the development size will depend on the desired integration level with your management systems (ERP, Commercial Automation, etc);
3. Homologation: A test file can be sent to the EDI Attendance Island for file estructure validation;
4. Production: send the file for processing.

## Technical Support

The EDI capture solution counts on an Attendance Island for support, responsible for:

1. Support to the integration and homologation by the client;
2. Support of 1st level on the production stage;
3. Interface with the internal Cielo areas and with VANs partners (TIVIT and GXS), for support of 2nd and 3rd level.

### Exceptions

- \*Card brands on the VANs model (Amex, vouchers, etc.) are not enabled for EDI channel.

# Concepts

## What is it?

The EDI - Eletronic Data Interchange is a channel of capture and processing of transactions in lot, through changing the files between the client, the files transmission partner (VANs) and Cielo.

## What is it for?

- To authorize transactions of a non-present card, mainly recurring transactions, example: Publishers, Insurers, Gyms, etc.
- To cancel card transactions, present or not, independently on the channel where the authorization was performed: Machine, TEF, E-Commerce or EDI.
- IATA Transactions: Used by International Airline Companies that are part of the IATA and GDS systems..
- Electronic statement: indicated to clients with large transactions volume, with the purpose of making the financial conciliation easier.

## How does it work?

- The client, after the accreditation on Cielo, requests the integration documents and the creation of a mailbox for the sending of the EDI files.
- Develops an integration between his management systems, backoffice or commercial automation to format the transactions according to EDI layout (transactions file).
- The EDI Attendance Island and the Cielo partner (VAN), prest the required support to the client during the integration stage.
- The costumer sends the transaction files, on the specific format (layout) of the EDI, to the electronic mailbox. Excpetion: IATA transactions have their own layouts.
- These transactions are sent to the Cielo systems, which will perform the monday to saturday processing and the sending of these transactions to the respective card brands, for their authorization or cancellation.
- Cielo returns the costumer's file in up to 2 days, with the processing result of all transactions (approved or denied with their reasons).

## General Considerations

- The return file will be available to the Establishment in up to 48 hours, using the same layout.
- The Remittance of Sales or cancellation submitted until 12h00 will be returned in D+1. Files submitted after 12h00, will be considered a move of the posterior day and its return will be in D+2.
- The moves are processed from monday to saturday. There are no processings on sundays.
- There can be sent credit card transactions from the brands: Visa, MasterCard, ELO (except on the IATA modality) and Diners.
- Files transactions from Airline Companies are not contemplated in this manual. They have specific layout..
- **We don't have homologation environment for this service**.

## Names of the returns from the files:

- When sending a Cancellation Submission, the system may return two types of files: "Retmov" or "Visa Error".
- “Retmov”: return file with all transactions (approved or denied).
- “Visa Erro”: transactions that weren't performed due to a structure problem from the sent file, having all transactions not submitted.
- Possible typing erros, as well as on the file structure are the costumer's responsability.

# Formatting tips of the EDI files

## Operation Summary (OS)

Identifies the lot number, sales transaction group.

## Sale Receipt (SR)

Each sale is registered in a sale receipt.

- Each Operation Summary (OS) may have up to 9.999 Sale Receipts (SRs).
- The transactions will have to be grouped by operation type (payment in one lump sum or store installment), having to create an OS specific for each one of them.
- For each transaction group (lot/OS) it must be generated a move containing header, detail(s) and trailler..
- For each card machine number, all rules above must be applied.
- It must be submitted header, detail and trailler for each card machine and for each operation summary (OS).
- The file must be formated with 1 single lot (OS) of intallment sales per card machine and 1 sale lot (OS) in one lump sum per card machine.
