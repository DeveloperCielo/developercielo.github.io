# 3DS 2.0 Authentication

## What is 3DS 2.0?

**EMV 3DS**, also known as **3DS 2.0** is a new authentication technology developed by the payments industry in order to reduce the risk of fraud without harming the conversion rate. This new version analyzes several variables used as a criteria to determine the cardholder authencity, allowing in some cases decreased cardholder authentication interactions (challenges), without risking the merchant's _Liability Shift_. 

**Main benefits:**

- Java Script integration;
- Responsive authentication interface for mobile;
- Decreased cardholder authentication interactions (challenges);  
- Minimize fraudulent transactions;

**Key words:** Credit and Debit Card Authentication, EMVCO, 3DS 2.0, Visa, Mastercard, E-Commerce

## Who is able to use the 3DS 2.0?

All the e-Commerce merchant must adapt itself to the solution from May 2019 for the brands release. The 3DS 2.0 
is valid for all the eCommerce transactions, whether it is debit, credit or prepaid card. All the merchants that have a high chargeback/fraud rate, the solution should be even more useful for the benefit of passing the liability shift to the issue bank.

## What is required to use 3DS 2.0?

The merchant must attend the below requirements to use 3DS 2.0:

- Cielo E-Commerce 1.5 or 3.0 affiliation;
- Registered in the 3DS 2.0 (request for eCommerce Support);
- Integrate the authorization process;
- Integrate the authentication process;

<aside class="notice">In case you implement the authentication process apart from Cielo (External Authentication), skip to the authorization step.</aside>

## Card Brands and Issuers Available

In order to send transactions with request for 3DS 2.0 authentication, it is important that, besides Cielo, the issuer and the card brand are ready with the solution. 
Currently are available:

**- Mastercard:** the brand has a Stand-In model, in case that the issuer is not able yet to respond an authenticated request using 3DS 2.0 EMV. In this scenario, Mastercard evaluates the uploaded data, for example the client's historical behavioral and transactional classifying authentication requests as "Low Risk" and "No Low Risk" in Stand-In mode. With this information, the Issuers have a protection even if they do not have their own solution of 3DS 2.0, and will have greater confidence in authenticated transactions. In Stand-In cases, Mastercard will respond to the authentication in 100% of cases silently (no challenge to the carrier) and, once the transaction has been authenticated, the liability in case of fraud will remain with the Issuer.

<aside class="notice">Issuers that are ready with its own solution of 3DS 2.0 Mastercard: Santander (Debit e Credit), PagSeguro (Credit), C6 (Debit e Credit), Realize (Credit), Itaú (Credit) e Acesso (Credit). The rest of the issuers will work,  for the time being, with the Mastercard Stand-In solution.</aside>

**- Visa:** the card brand does not has a Stand-In model and just issuers 100% ready with its own solution are able to respond to an authenticated request using the 3DS 2.0 EMV.

<aside class="notice"> Issuers that are ready with its own solution of 3DS 2.0 Visa: Caixa (Credit), Santander (Debit e Credit) e Itaú (Debit e Credit – currently with silent authentication, no challenge). </aside>

## What is the Data Only - Notification Only

Data Only is an extra and optional field available to the merchant that can be used exclusively for MasterCard.

To use is, it must be parameterized the field **bpmpi_auth_notifyonly** described in the **Authentication Step - Step 3 - Mapping Classes**. In the Data Only model, the additional 3DS 2.0 fields are mapped in the same way, and sent to Mastercard and Issuing Banks, however, without requiring authentication.

The benefit of using Data Only is to enrich the Issuing Banks and MasterCard database, who will receive more information about the holders of each merchant. This field seeks to improve the Silent Authentication and Issuer approval rating, considering the current context where the market is growing to integrate with the new 2.0 authentication protocol. In addition, from May 2019, Mastercard will charge an additional _fee_ for unauthenticated transaction of the acquirer, which may impact on the price negotiated between Cielo and the merchant. Data Only will exempt the _fee_ charged.

It is worth noting  that in this model, since there is no authentication of the Issuer, the risk of chargeback for fraud remains with the merchant.

## Payment Flow 3DS 2.0 | With challenge

![Flow with challenge 02](https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/images/pagamento-com-desafio-02_-_en.jpg)

1. The holder fills the card details at the checkout of the merchant.
2. The merchant set the 3DS 2.0 solution from Cielo via script for authentication.
3. Cielo's 3DS 2.0 solution sends the buyer's information to the MPI (authentication platform).
4. MPI communicates with the card brand to process the authentication. The brand identifies the issuer of the card, and sends the buyer's information for analysis. The issuer identifies the holder as a possible risk, then, requires the challenge and returns the Authentication URL.
5. A card brand returns an authentication URL to MPI.
6. MPI returns the authentication URL to the 3DS 2.0 solution.
7. The 3DS 2.0 solution return the authentication URL to the merchant via script.
8. The script shows the authentication screen via lightbox.
9. The holder solve the challenge on the issuer screen.
10. The issuer returns the authentication result to the card brand.
11. The card brand return the authentication result to the MPI.
12. The MPI return the authentication result to the 3DS 2.0 solution.
13. The 3DS 2.0 solution return the authentication result to the merchant via script (CAVV, ECI e XID).
14. The merchant sends an authentication request with the authentication data to the API Cielo 3.0.
15. The API Cielo 3.0 returns the authentication result to the merchant.
16. The merchant notifies the payment result.

## Payment Flow 3DS 2.0 | Without challenge

![Flow without challenge](https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/images/pagamento-sem-desafio_-_en.jpg)

1. The holder fills the card details at the checkout of the merchant.
2. The merchant set the 3DS 2.0 solution from Cielo via script for authentication.
3. Cielo's 3DS 2.0 solution sends the buyer's information to the MPI (authentication platform).
4. MPI communicates with the card brand to process the authentication. The brand identifies the issuer of the card, and sends the buyer's information for analysis. The issuer identifies the holder as a possible risk, then, requires the challenge and returns the Authentication URL.
5. The card brand returns the silent authentication result (CAVV e ECI).
6. The MPI returns the silent authentication result to the 3DS 2.0 solution.
7. The 3DS 2.0 solution returns the silent authentication result to the merchant via script.
8. The merchant sends an authentication request with the authentication data to the API Cielo 3.0.
9. The API Cielo 3.0 returns the authentication result to the merchant.
10. The merchant notifies the payment result.

## How does the authenticated authorization via 3DS 2.0 work?

The authorization process using authentication through 3DS 2.0 occurs in two steps:

1. Authentication
2. Authorization

The steps below describes the detailed process:

![Fluxo 3DS 2.0]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/fluxo-env3ds-eng.jpg)

1. Cardholder choose to pay with credit or debit card.
2. Merchant requests authentication through Cielo solution.
3. Authentication platform can perform two ways: request cardholder authentication or perform the authentication silently. In the first case, the platform will return the Authentication URL to the merchant. In the second case, the next step is already is the return with the authentication result.
4. Merchant presents the authentication interface on _lightbox_ (Issuer Authentication URL).
5. The cardholder authenticates in the issuer (process known as **complete the challenge** process)
6. Card issuer returns authentication result to 3DS platform, which pass it back to the merchant.
7. Merchant decides if they want to go ahead with authorization process. Once they decide to go ahead, the authentication result must be submitted with the authorization. 
8. Cielo returns the authorization result to the merchant, which passes it to the cardholder.

## Authentication - STEP 1. Access Token Request

The solution is composed by the access token request via the API and authentication request via Java Script.

|Environment | Endpoint | Authorization |
|---|---|---|
| **SANDBOX** | https://mpisandbox.braspag.com.br | **Basic _(Authorization)_**<br><br>The Authorization must be generated concatenating "ClientID", colon character (":") and "ClientSecret"<br><br>Ex. dba3a8db-fa54-40e0-8bab-7bfb9b6f2e2e:D/ilRsfoqHlSUChwAMnlyKdDNd7FMsM7cU/vo02REag=<br><br>after this, encode the result in base 64. <br>Then, this will generate an alphanumeric code that will be used in the access token request. For test purposes, use the following data:<br><br>ClientID: **dba3a8db-fa54-40e0-8bab-7bfb9b6f2e2e**<br>ClientSecret: **D/ilRsfoqHlSUChwAMnlyKdDNd7FMsM7cU/vo02REag=**|
| --- | --- |
| **PRODUCTION** | https://mpi.braspag.com.br | Please contact our support team to generate the "ClientID" and "ClientSecret" after integrating on sandbox environment. |

## Authentication - STEP 2. Script implementation

This step contains the _script_ and the mapping of _classes_ implementation responsable to comunicate with the authentication platform from brands and issuers. The example below shows the basic implementation. It is recommended that the snippet is placed at the end of the checkout HTML code:

Events Description

| **Event** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| onReady | This is triggered when the script is completely loaded, which includes validation of the access token, indicating that the checkout is ready to initiate authentication process |
| onSuccess | It is triggered when the card is elegible and the authentication process is successfully finished. In this case, the variables CAVV, XID and ECI are returned. These data must be sent in together with the authorization request. In this scenario, if the transaction is authorized, the liability shift is transferred to the issuer.|
| onFailure | It is triggered when the card is elegible but the authentication process failed for some reason. In this case, only ECI variable is returned. If the merchant decide to proceed with the authorization, the ECI must also be sent in the request. In this scenario if the transaction is authorized, the liability shift remains with the merchant.|
| onUnenrolled | It is triggered when the card is not elegible, in other words, the cardholder and/or issuer does not support the authentication program. In this case, only ECI variable is returned. If the merchant decides to proceed with the authorization, the ECI must be sent together with the authorization. If the transaction is authorized, the liability shift remains with the merchant.|
| onDisabled | It is triggered when the merchant chooses not to submit the cardholder to the authentication process. (&quot;bpmpi\_auth&quot; class set as false). In this scenario, if the transaction is authorized, the liability shift remains with the merchant.|
| onError | It is triggered when the authentication process receives a systemic error. In this scenario, if the transaction is authorized, the liability shift remains with the merchant.|

Request Parameters Description

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Environment | Indicates the environment to be used (Sandbox or Production)| String <br>**SDB** – _Sandbox (test environment)_ **PRD** – _Production (production environment)_ |
| Debug | Boolean that identifies if debug mode is activated. When sent as true, the platform will generate the report on the browser's debug mechanism.| Boolean <br>_true<br>false_ |

**NOTE!**

The JavaScript file must be saved in the server where the merchant application is hosted. To download the file on Sandbox environment, access:

Output Description

| **Output** | **Description** | **Type** | **Size** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cavv | Authentication signature | Alphanumeric | 28 |
| Xid | Authentication request ID | Alphanumeric | 28 |
| Eci | E-commerce indicator code, which represents the authentication result | Numeric | Max 2 |

## Authentication - STEP 3. Mapping Classes

Classes that must be mapped in your HTML code.

Once the class is mapped to it's given field, the script is able to retrieve the value contained in the field and submit it to compose the authentication request. 

<aside class="warning">The higher amount of fields parametrized, the higher is the chance of having a transparent authentication, since the issuer will have more data for the risk analysis.</aside>

<aside class="notice">The # character indicated in the field must be replaced by the number representing the item index. <br> Example: bpmpi_item_1_productName' represents the first item of the cart.</aside>

| bpmpi_mdd1 | Extra data set by the merchant | Alphanumeric | Max 255 | No | No |
| bpmpi_mdd2 | Extra data set by the merchant | Alphanumeric | Max 255 | No | No |
| bpmpi_mdd3 | Extra data set by the merchant | Alphanumeric | Max 255 | No | No |
| bpmpi_mdd4 | Extra data set by the merchant | Alphanumeric | Max 255 | No | No |
| bpmpi_mdd5 | Extra data set by the merchant | Alphanumeric | Max 255 | No | No |

## Authentication - STEP 4. Implementing authentication request 

The &quot;**bpmpi\_Authenticate()**&quot; event must be requested when finishing the checkout(finishing the order). Example:

&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot;onclick=&quot;bpmpi_authenticate()&quot; /&gt;

## Authorization STEP via Cielo E-Commerce 3.0

Once the authentication is finished, the authorization should be submitted using the external authentication data model  &quot;external authentication&quot; (**ExternalAuthentication** ).
This procedure is also valid for merchants that performed authentication outside of Cielo (External MPI)

You can find below an example of the authorization request including authentication data to CIELO 3.0 API:
