# 3DS 2.0 Authentication

## What is 3DS 2.0?

**EMV 3DS**, also known as **3DS 2.0** is a new authentication technology developed by the payments industry in order to reduce the risk of fraud without harming the conversion rate. This new version analyzes several variables used as a criteria to determine the cardholder authencity, allowing in some cases decreased cardholder authentication interactions (challenges), without risking the merchant's _Liability Shift_. 

**Main benefits:**

- Java Script integration;
- Responsive authentication interface for mobile;
- Decreased cardholder authentication interactions (challenges);  
- Minimize fraudulent transactions;

**Key words:** Credit and Debit Card Authentication, EMVCO, 3DS 2.0, Visa, Mastercard, E-Commerce

## Who is able to use the 3DS 2.0?

All the e-Commerce merchant must adapt itself to the solution from May 2019 for the brands release. The 3DS 2.0 
is valid for all the eCommerce transactions, whether it is debit, credit or prepaid card. All the merchants that have a high chargeback/fraud rate, the solution should be even more useful for the benefit of passing the liability shift to the issue bank.

## What is required to use 3DS 2.0?

The merchant must attend the below requirements to use 3DS 2.0:

- Cielo E-Commerce 1.5 or 3.0 affiliation;
- Registered in the 3DS 2.0 (request for eCommerce Support);
- Integrate the authorization process;
- Integrate the authentication process;

<aside class="notice">In case you implement the authentication process apart from Cielo (External Authentication), skip to the authorization step.</aside>

## Card Brands and Issuers Available

In order to send transactions with request for 3DS 2.0 authentication, it is important that, besides Cielo, the issuer and the card brand are ready with the solution. 
Currently are available:

**- Mastercard:** the brand has a Stand-In model, in case that the issuer is not able yet to respond an authenticated request using 3DS 2.0 EMV. In this scenario, Mastercard evaluates the uploaded data, for example the client's historical behavioral and transactional classifying authentication requests as "Low Risk" and "No Low Risk" in Stand-In mode. With this information, the Issuers have a protection even if they do not have their own solution of 3DS 2.0, and will have greater confidence in authenticated transactions. In Stand-In cases, Mastercard will respond to the authentication in 100% of cases silently (no challenge to the carrier) and, once the transaction has been authenticated, the liability in case of fraud will remain with the Issuer. The decision to authorize the transaction or not is to the Issuer.

**- Visa:** the card brand does not has a Stand-In model and just issuers 100% ready with its own solution are able to respond to an authenticated request using the 3DS 2.0 EMV.

## What is the Data Only - Notification Only

Data Only is an extra and optional field available to the merchant that can be used exclusively for MasterCard.

To use is, it must be parameterized the field **bpmpi_auth_notifyonly** described in the **Authentication Step - Step 3 - Mapping Classes**. In the Data Only model, the additional 3DS 2.0 fields are mapped in the same way, and sent to Mastercard and Issuing Banks, however, without requiring authentication.

The benefit of using Data Only is to enrich the Issuing Banks and MasterCard database, who will receive more information about the holders of each merchant. This field seeks to improve the Silent Authentication and Issuer approval rating, considering the current context where the market is growing to integrate with the new 2.0 authentication protocol. In addition, from May 2019, Mastercard will charge an additional _fee_ for unauthenticated transaction of the acquirer, which may impact on the price negotiated between Cielo and the merchant. Data Only will exempt the _fee_ charged.

It is worth noting  that in this model, since there is no authentication of the Issuer, the risk of chargeback for fraud remains with the merchant.

## Payment Flow 3DS 2.0 | With challenge

![Flow with challenge 02](https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/sites/default/files/images/pagamento-com-desafio-02_-_en.jpg)

1. The holder fills the card details at the checkout of the merchant.
2. The merchant set the 3DS 2.0 solution from Cielo via script for authentication.
3. Cielo's 3DS 2.0 solution sends the buyer's information to the MPI (authentication platform).
4. MPI communicates with the card brand to process the authentication. The brand identifies the issuer of the card, and sends the buyer's information for analysis. The issuer identifies the holder as a possible risk, then, requires the challenge and returns the Authentication URL.
5. A card brand returns an authentication URL to MPI.
6. MPI returns the authentication URL to the 3DS 2.0 solution.
7. The 3DS 2.0 solution return the authentication URL to the merchant via script.
8. The script shows the authentication screen via lightbox.
9. The holder solve the challenge on the issuer screen.
10. The issuer returns the authentication result to the card brand.
11. The card brand return the authentication result to the MPI.
12. The MPI return the authentication result to the 3DS 2.0 solution.
13. The 3DS 2.0 solution return the authentication result to the merchant via script (CAVV, ECI e XID).
14. The merchant sends an authentication request with the authentication data to the API Cielo 3.0.
15. The API Cielo 3.0 returns the authentication result to the merchant.
16. The merchant notifies the payment result.

## How does the authenticated authorization via 3DS 2.0 work?

The authorization process using authentication through 3DS 2.0 occurs in two steps:

1. Authentication
2. Authorization

The steps below describes the detailed process:

![Fluxo 3DS 2.0]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/fluxo-env3ds-eng.jpg)

1. Cardholder choose to pay with credit or debit card.
2. Merchant requests authentication through Cielo solution.
3. Authentication platform can perform two ways: request cardholder authentication or perform the authentication silently. In the first case, the platform will return the Authentication URL to the merchant. In the second case, the next step is already is the return with the authentication result.
4. Merchant presents the authentication interface on _lightbox_ (Issuer Authentication URL).
5. The cardholder authenticates in the issuer (process known as **complete the challenge** process)
6. Card issuer returns authentication result to 3DS platform, which pass it back to the merchant.
7. Merchant decides if they want to go ahead with authorization process. Once they decide to go ahead, the authentication result must be submitted with the authorization. 
8. Cielo returns the authorization result to the merchant, which passes it to the cardholder.

## Authentication - STEP 1. Access Token Request

The solution is composed by the access token request via the API and authentication request via Java Script.

3. SDK IOS Authentication: ideal for deployment in-app IOS in [websites](https://developercielo.github.io/en/manual/integracao-sdk-ios)

## Authorization with Authentication

After authentication is completed, submit to the authorization procedure, sending the authentication data in the model of quot;external authentication&quot; (node **ExternalAuthentication** ).
