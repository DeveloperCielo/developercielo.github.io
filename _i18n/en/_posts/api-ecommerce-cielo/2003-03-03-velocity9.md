# What is Velocity

Velocity is a type of fraud prevention mechanism that specifically analyzes the concept of **"speed x transactional data" **. It analyzes how often certain data is used and whether that data is inscribed in a list of behaviors succeptible to security actions.

For merchants operating in the e-commerce market and eventually receiving fraudulent transactions, Velocity is a product that will identify behaviors suspect of fraud. The tool is intended to assist in fraud analysis at a much lower cost than a more traditional market tool.

It is an ally in the evaluation of suspect buying behaviors because the calculations will be based on `traceability elements`.

The Velocity offers 4 types of functionalities to validate transactional data:

| Functionality         | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Velocity safety rules | The Merchantdefines a set of security rules that will evaluate if certain transactional data is repeated in a suspicious time interval |
| Quarantine            | Creation of a list of data that will be analyzed for a determined period of time before being considered valid or fraudulent |
| BlackList             | Creation of a list of data that, when identified, prevents the transaction from being executed, avoiding the creation of a fraudulent transaction |
| Whitelist             | Creation of a list of data that, when identified, allows the transaction to be executed, even if there are security rules in action |

The functionality must be contracted separately, and later enabled in your store by the Cielo Ecommerce Support team via Admin 3.0 

## Integration

Velocity works by analyzing data sent in the standard Cielo Ecommerce API integration. It is not necessary to add any additional node to the store integration for the creation of the sale, but it will be necessary to change the way the data is received `Response`.

When Velocity is active, the transaction response will bring a specific node called "Velocity" with the details of the analysis.
