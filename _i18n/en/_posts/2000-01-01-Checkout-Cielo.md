# Manual Checkout Cielo

The goal of this documentation is to orientate the developer about the integration method of Cielo Checkout API, a simplified solution where the customer is redirected to an online payment page secured by Cielo, providing a high level of security, attending the more strict safety regulations (PCI). In general, Cielo Checkout is a payment solution projected to increase conversion rates, make easier the purchase process, reduce frauds and operational costs. At this documentation, we described all functionalities of the integration, technical parameter and specially the examples of codes to facilitate your development.

Cielo Checkout uses a REST technology that should be used when a “shopping cart” must to be sent, in other words, the customer can browse on website, choose one or more products to add on shopping cart and then finish the purchase. There is also an option of [integration by button](https://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Cielo/#shipping) that is always used if you have not a “shopping cart” at your store or when you want to associate a quick purchase directly to a product.

During the Cielo Checkout's integration, you will find some steps and redirections. Observe the flow bellow

![Fluxo de integração Checkout Cielo]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/fluxo-checkout.svg)

After the cardholder (consumer) select their purchases and press the "Buy" button on the virtual store already integrated with Checkout Cielo, the flow goes this way:

1. Cielo API returns the CheckoutURL, which should be used by the store to redirect the client to safety payment environment of Cielo (Cielo Checkout page)
2. The store redirects the client to the URL returned by Cielo
3. The cardholder enters the payment details and completes the purchase
4. The Cielo Checkout redirects the client to the Return URL chosen by the store, set in [Backoffice Checkout Cielo](https://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/) this solution, or the Return URL, set through integration via API.
5. The store notifies the customer that the process has been completed and that it will receive more information about the purchase and payment by e-mail.
6. The Cielo Checkout sends a notification POST to the Notification URL, set in Backoffice
7. The store process the purchase order using the data from notification POST and, if the transaction is authorized, the order is freed.

# Extended Validation Certificate

## What is SSL Certificate?

The Extended Validation Certificate for web server offers authenticity and integrity of data from a web site, provides customers of virtual stores the guarantee that they are actually accessing the site they want, and not a fraudster site.

Specialized companies are responsible for making domain validation and depending on the type of certificate, also the owner of the domain entity.

![Fluxo de integração Checkout Cielo]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/fluxo-checkout.svg)

### Internet Explorer:

![Certificado EV Internet Explorer]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/certificado-ie.jpg)

### Firefox

![Certificado EV Firefox]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/certificado-firefox.jpg)

### Google Chrome

![Certificado EV Google Chrome]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/certificado-chrome.jpg)

## What is EV SSL Certificate?

The EV Certificate was released in the market recently and ensures a higher level of security for customers of online stores.

It is a certificate of greater confidence and when https is accessed, the address bar turns green, giving more reliability to site visitors.

"During the Cielo Checkout's integration, you will find some steps and redirections. Observe the flow bellow:

## How to install the Extended Validation Certificate in the shop server?

You just need to install the three following files on the Trustedstore server. Cielo does not support the installation of the certificate. If you are unsure on how to perform install the EV Certificate, then you should contact your server vendor support.

* [Root certificate](./attachment/root.crt)
* [Intermediate certificate](./attachment/intermediaria.crt)

# Overview

In this guide will be presented an overview of Cielo Checkout and the technical mechanism of integration with shopping cart or button. For every purchase order, the target is convert it in a sale. A sale with card can be characterized by an authorized and captured transaction.

<aside class="warning">An authorized transaction only generates credit for the retailer if it is captured (or confirmed)</aside>

After the conclusion of the integration stage with Cielo, it’s essential that the retailer or online store manager has knowledge of functional process that will be part of the daily routine of store, like the follow-up of the financial transactions, status of each sale, actions (capture and cancellation) related to sales, charge statement, and so on. See the complement material about [BackOffice Checkout Cielo](http://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/).

## Considerations about the integration

* The store register must be activated at Cielo
* You must define an appropriate timeout on the HTTP requests to Cielo; we recommend 30 seconds.
* The Root certificate of certifying body (CA) of our Web Service must be registered at Truststore to be used. Because our certifying body has wider acceptance in the market, probably it’s already registered on Truststore at our own operational system. See the section [Certificated Extended Validation](#certificado-extended-validation) for more information.
* The monetary value is always handled as intire values, without representation of decimals place, in such case the last two digits are considered as “centavos”. Example: R$ 1.286,87 is represented as 128687; R$ 1,00 is represented as 100.

<aside class="notice">See the section [Certificated Extended Validation](#certificado-extended-validation) for more information</aside>

## Cielo Checkout testing mode

The Cielo Checkout testing mode is a tool that allows to test the integration between your website and your platform. With the testing mode you can execute transactions as integration evolves and you can simulate backgrounds to test different payment's methods.

### Testing mode activation/validation

The testing mode can be activated on Settings tab:

![Modo de teste]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/checkout-cielo-modo-teste.png)

In this area there is a selection box, that once been marked, will enable the Cielo Checkout testing mode. The mode only will starts when the selection has been saved.

![Ativação Modo de teste]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/checkout-cielo-modo-teste-ativacao.png)

When the option is saved, a red stripe will be exhibited on top area of screen. It will be displayed at all screens of Cielo Checkout Backoffice and the checkout screen of Cielo Checkout.

This stripe indicates that your Cielo Checkout store is operating now in a testing environment, in other words, all transaction executed in this mode will be considered as a test.

![Modo de teste ativado]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/checkout-cielo-modo-teste-ativado.png)

### How transact on Testing Mode

The transactions execution on testing mode happens in normal form. The information of transaction will be sent via POST or API, using the parameters as described on topic [Integração com carrinho](#integração-carrinho-de-compras), however, the payment methods to be used will be simulated methods.

To execute test transactions with different payment methods, follow the next rules:

**a - Credit Card Transactions:**

To test credit cards it’s necessary to define two important data; the authorization status of card and the fraud analysis return.

**Status of Credit Card Authorization **

|Card Final Digit|Returned Status|
|---|---|
|0, 1, 2, 3 ou 4|Authorized|
|5, 6, 7, 8 ou 9|Unauthorized|

* **Example**: Authorized transaction, High risk;
* **Credit card Number**: 5404434242930107
* **Customer name**: Maria Alto

**b - Boleto Bancario**

You simply carry out the purchase process without any changes on your proceeding. The boleto created on testing mode will always be a simulated boleto.

**c - Online Debit**

It’s necessary to inform the transaction status of online debit transaction. This process happens like in the anti fraud of credit card described above, with change for buyer name.

**Debit Status**

|Customer Lastname|Status|
|---|---|
|Paid|Paid|
|Any name|Unauthorized|

* **Example**: Unauthorized Status.
* **Customer name**: Maria Pereira

**d - Testing transaction**

All the transaction executed on testing mode will be displayed as normal transactions on Order Tab of Cielo Checkout, but, they will be marked as testing transactions and won’t be counted combined with all transactions executed outside of testing environment.

![Transações de teste]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/checkout-cielo-modo-teste-transacoes-de-teste.png)

These transaction will have a symbol of test to distinguish of other transactions. They can be captured or canceled using the same proceedings of real transactions.

# Integration flow

O objetivo desta documentação é orientar o desenvolvedor sobre o método de integração da API Checkout Cielo, solução simplificada na qual o consumidor é direcionado para uma página de pagamento online segura da Cielo, proporcionando um alto nível de confiança, dentro das mais rígidas normas de segurança (PCI). Em linhas gerais, o Checkout Cielo é uma solução de pagamento projetada para aumentar a conversão das vendas, simplificar o processo de compra, reduzir fraudes e custos operacionais.
Nesta documentação estão descritas todas as funcionalidades desta integração, os parâmetros técnicos e principalmente os códigos de exemplos para facilitar o seu desenvolvimento.

O Checkout Cielo utiliza uma tecnologia REST que deve ser usada quando houver um *“carrinho de compras”* a ser enviado, ou seja, no caso do consumidor navegar pelo site e escolher 1 ou mais produtos para adicionar ao carrinho e depois, então, finalizar a compra. Há também opção de [integração via botão](#botão-de-produto) usada sempre que não houver um *“carrinho de compras”* em sua loja ou quando se deseja associar uma compra rápida direta a um produto.

Durante a integração com o Checkout Cielo, alguns passos e alguns redirecionamentos ocorrerão. A imagem abaixo ilustra esse fluxo:

![Fluxo de integração Checkout Cielo]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/fluxo-checkout.svg)

1. Cielo API returns the CheckoutURL, which should be used by the store to redirect the client to safety payment environment of Cielo (Cielo Checkout page)
2. The store redirects the client to the URL returned by Cielo
3. The cardholder enters the payment details and completes the purchase
4. The Cielo Checkout redirects the client to the Return URL chosen by the store, set in [Backoffice Checkout Cielo](https://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/) this solution, or the Return URL, set through integration via API.
5. The store notifies the customer that the process has been completed and that it will receive more information about the purchase and payment by e-mail.
6. The Cielo Checkout sends a notification POST to the Notification URL, set in Backoffice
7. The store process the purchase order using the data from notification POST and, if the transaction is authorized, the order is freed.

## Cielo's Checkout URLs

The store must configure three URLs (notification, feedback and status) in your [Backoffice Checkout Cielo](https://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/), the "Settings" tab. See the screenshot below:

* **Return URL** - website in which the buyer will be redirected to the order of purchase. No data is exchanged or sent to that URL. This URL takes only the buyer, after finalizing the purchase, a page defined by the store. This page should be set at [Backoffice Checkout Cielo](https://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/), tab "Settings"
* **Notification URL** - At the end of a transaction is sent an HTTP POST with all the data of the sale to the Notification URL previously registered in the Backoffice Checkout Cielo. The notification POST is sent only when the transaction is completed, regardless of whether there was a change of the transaction status. The URL must contain a page prepared to receive the parameters defined in the Parameters table formats for integration with notification via POST language / module with which your site has been developed, which will receive the HTTP POST.
* **Status Change URL** - When an application has changed their status, will be sending a HTTP post to the Status Change URL previously registered in the [Backoffice Checkout Cielo](https://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/). The POST of status change does not contain the data of the shopping cart, only the identification data. The URL should contain a page prepared to receive the parameters defined in the [Parameters table formats for integration](https://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Cielo/english.html#integration-parameters) with the Status Change POST via language / module with which your site was developed.

## Return URL

The Return URL is used by Cielo to redirect the customer back to the store as soon as payment is complete. This store page must be prepared to receive customer order flow and warn you that the process has been completed and that it will receive more information soon.

At the end of a transaction, the customer can be redirected to the return URL. By clicking "BACK" button on the sales receipt of sales screen, the buyer will be directed to the previously UR registered return URL in the Back Office or sent via contract in the API, ie Checkout Cielo offers two options to configure the return URL:

* via Backoffice: the return URL is fixed for all purchases.
* via Technical Agreement: the Return URL can be parameterized with every purchase, or is flexible.

 ### Via Backoffice

Via Backoffice, the URL is registered by the merchant in Cielo website, at restricted area on the item Online Sales> Checkout Cielo> Store Settings.

### Via Technical Agreement in API

To use the return url via technical contract (API), follows the parameter that must be sent to Checkout via technical contract:

```json
"Options": {
  "ReturnUrl": "http://url-de-retorno"
}
```

#### Features

* The Return URL via contract is only available via API integration.
* If a return URL is sent via API, it will have priority over the registered URL in the Backoffice.
* Checkout integration Cielo via button, you can only use the return URL option via backoffice.

### Notification URL

The notification URL is that Cielo will use to send the data of the transaction, the cart and the authorization to finish the integration stream. Upon receiving the notification, the store will have all the information about the shopping cart, order and may use this information to feed your system.

### Endpoint

Endpoint is the URL to where the requests with data of shopping cart are sent. All the requests must be sent using the method HTTP POST, to endpoint `https://cieloecommerce.cielo.com.br/api/public/v1/orders`.

### Authentication of store

```shell
-H "MerchantId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" \
```

```php

In this case, all the requests sent for Cielo must be authenticated for the store. The authentication consists at sending the Merchant Id, that is unique identifier of store provided for Cielo after the affiliation of store. The authentication of store must be done through the sending of field of header HTTP `MerchandId`, as illustrated below and next:

`MerchantId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

<aside class="notice">Remember to replace `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` by your MerchantId.

### Integration errors

There are two types of error that can happen during the integration process with Cielo Checkout. Here they are:

* **Before the exhibition in Checkout screen**: This means that there is a mistake in data that has been sent in the transaction. Mandatory data probably has been forgotten or they probably are in an invalid format;
* **After the exhibition in Checkout screen (when the sale is finished)**: This means that there is an impediment of registration that limit the sale. Things like blocked affiliation, error in data saved at registration or problems in own checkout.

## Button

Integration via Button is a method of purchase used always that there isn’t a “shopping cart” in your store or when you want to associate a quick direct purchase to a product, as a promotion in a homepage jumping the cart stage.

The integration via button also can be used to send an e-mail marketing or a charge via e-mail, in other words, adding a button (HTTP) referent to a product/service to be bought/paid. Or always that you want to make available a quick sale.

To use this feature, it’s necessary register the product that you want to sell, your information, and then just copy the source code created for this button. The inclusion of products is done inside the [Backoffice Cielo Checkout](http://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/), at menu of Products/Register Product.

![Integração com botão]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/checkout-cielo-integracao-botao.png)

### Button characteristics

* Each button created leads to a certain product, only.
* The price of product can not be changed on Checkout screen.
* It’s not necessary to develop a cart..
* The registration of product is mandatory for creating the button.

Each button has a unique code that just allows to buy that certain product in the condition of price and shipping registered. Therefore, the fraudster can’t change any of these information when submitting it to the purchase, because the Cielo Checkout will search all data of product in the registration of [Backoffice Cielo Checkout](http://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/), and has validity the data of registration.

### Parameters for product registration

Below you see the information necessary to register the product.

|Parameter|Description|Size Min.|Size Máx.|Mandatory|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Type of Product|Signal if you are selling material goods, service, or digital goods, it won’t be presented the option of shipping type.|n/a|n/a|Yes|
|SKU|Product identification code|1|50|No|
|Title|Product title|1|50|yes|
|Description|Product description|1|255|Yes|
|Price|Total amount of order in **in cents** (ex.: R$1,00 =100).|11|14|Yes|
|Shipping/Delivery|Choose among the Shipping options (Correios, Flat Postage Cost , Free Shipping, pick up on store, no charge).|n/a|n/a|Yes|
|Origin CEP|This field only appears for a Correios shipping, and must be filled with CEP, from will leave the product for purposes of shipping calculation.|9|9|Yes|

|Sending method|This field only appears for Product Type similar to Physical Material and Shipping Type similar to Fixed Shipping.|n/a|n/a|Yes|
|URL|This field only appears for Product type similar to Digital.|n/a|n/a|Yes|

#### Button example:

```html
<form method='post' action='https://cieloecommerce.cielo.com.br/transactional/Checkout/BuyNow' target='blank'>
    <input type='hidden' name='id' value=00000000-0000-0000-000000000000/><input type='image' name='submit' alt='Comprar' src='https://cieloecommerce.cielo.com.br /BackOffice/Content/images/botao_comprar_3.jpg' />
</form>
```

Adding the button on your HTML page you have to copy the button HTML code created and put the HTML code on your website, as the example below:

Each button has a unique code that only allows to buy a certain product in the pricing and shipping conditions registered. Therefore, the fraudster can’t change any of these information on purchase submit, because Cielo Checkout will search all product data on [Backoffice Cielo Checkout](http://developercielo.github.io/Checkout-Backoffice/), and will be considered the registration data.

# Recurring Payment Schedule Integration

The recurring is the scheduling automatically process of credit transactions, in other words, a transaction that will be repeat automatically, without the need of the purchaser access the transacion screen, according to the rules defined at the moment of the scheduling.

<aside class="notice">In the case of one transaction won't be authorized, the Cielo Checkout executes the retry automatically; more details about automatically retry, see the section<a href="#retentativa">Retentativa</a>.</aside>

Recurring transaction are ideal for the business model that involves the subscription concept, plan or monthly payment in the charge method. Some examples are: schools, gym, book publishers, hosting and accomodation services, and others.

Difference between recurring payment and installment payment:

* **Installment**: It is a transaction split into several months. The total value of the sale commits the buyer's credit card limit regardless of the initial installment (see example below). The merchant receives the value of the sale in installments and not run the risk of one of the parcels be denied.
  * **EX**: Sale of R$ 1,000.00 installment in 2 times. Although the buyer pay only R $ 500.00 in the first installment, the value of the consumed credit limit is full, ie, R $ 1,000.00. If the card limit is less than or the amount is not released, the R $ 1,000.00 the transaction will be denied
* **Recurring**: They are different transactions on the same card at previously scheduled times. The first sale schedule future sales from a pre defined time interval (see example below). Each range will be a charge on your credit card. The recurring payment locks the card limit only debited value on the date of the first applicant and sales of the total sale.
  * **EX**: Venda de R$ 1.000,00 em 15/01/2015, com recorrência mensal e data final em 01/06/2015. Todo dia 15 haverá uma nova cobrança de R$1.000,00 no cartão do comprador, se repetindo até 15/05/2015, última data válida antes da data final.

A recurrence of the transaction Cielo Checkout has two settings: "Interval" and "Closing Date".

* **Interval** - repeating pattern and time interval between each transaction. This time lag between transactions can be: Monthly, Bimonthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual and Annual.
* **Closing Date** - Date that the recurrence process fails to occur.
The buyer's credit card data is stored securely within the Checkout Cielo, allowing its reuse in a recurring transaction. This data is not accessed by the retailer and that intelligence is controlled by Checkout Cielo.

### Request

Except the `Payment` object that contains a specific new element to the recurrence called `RecurrentPayment`, all other objects are equal to integration with Shopping Cart.

#### Payment object of Recurrence

|Field|Type|Compulsory|Size|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|BoletoDiscount|Numeric    Conditional|0. 3|Discount in percentage, for payments to be made with boleto.|
|Debit Discount|Numeric    Conditional|0. 3|Discount in percentage, for payments to be made with online debt.|
|**RecurrentPayment**|[RecurrentPayment](#recurrentpayment)|Conditional|Object required for recurring payments|

### Answer

```json
{
    "message": "The request is invalid.",
    "modelState": {
        "[Shipping.Type]": [
            "[Shipping.Type] pedidos com recorrência devem possuir o Shipping.Type 'WithoutShipping'."
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Error in recurrence

**Exemple**: Physical goods

As recurrence exists only in the API, if the developer sends as Physical Good, the API requires the type of shipping. If the technical agreement has the recurrence node, you can only send "Without shipping," which is not a valid type for physical goods (products). So you will receive the following reply:

## Recurrence button

The recurrence button is a method in the Checkout to perform the recurrence. You only need to registry the product, including the charge interval and the date for closing (optional), as the example bellow:

![Botão recorrência]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/images/checkout-botao-recorrencia.png)

<aside class="warning">If a button is used after the "End Date" registered, the transaction will present an error displaying "Oppss" in transactional screen. Data can be edited on the button editing screen in "Product Details"</aside>
