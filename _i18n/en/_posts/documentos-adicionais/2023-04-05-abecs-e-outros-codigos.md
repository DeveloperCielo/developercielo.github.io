# Return codes ABECS

> You can access information about the card brand rules for retrying transactions at [Card Brands Retry Program](){:target="_blank"}.

The **Brazilian Association of Credit Card and Services Companies (ABECS)** establishes as of July 15, 2020, the standardization of the return code of refused sales authorizations for both the physical payment and e-commerce solutions of the Brazilian market .

This normative measure seeks to bring benefits to the entire payment market, providing greater transparency in the understanding of the reason for the refusal of transactions, in addition to enabling greater assertiveness in the adoption of sales retentive strategies.

Cielo informs its customers that it's prepared to process transactions following this new market standard, below is the table of codes standardized by ABECS.

<aside class="notice">The AMEX flag codes have undergone a to/from in order to maintain two digits. We reinforce that this measure does not change the reasons for return.</aside>
